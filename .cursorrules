- CONFIDENCE - If you have high confidence in your solution, state that you have high confidence in your solution and make sure to explain why. Go ahead and make the change. If you are not confident, state that you are not confident and say why. Ask for more context or clarification. Ask for documentation. Or give me a range of options to choose from before proceeding. Don't write code before you have high confidence.
